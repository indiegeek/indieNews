# indieNews
A node app to fetch news for me daily

# Features
* Fetches topics from a user created array
* Outputs to a webpage with summaries and links to the full article
* When an article is clicked to be viewed it is marked as read on the page
* Article results are cached day to day so the api does not need to pull down more than a single day of data
* This app will be powered by NewsCatcher API https://newscatcherapi.com/, node, express, axios, etc
* For use as a personal homepage and news aggregator
